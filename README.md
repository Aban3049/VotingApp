Welcome to the Voting App repository, where voting is made secure and accessible through biometric authentication. This application allows administrators to create user profiles for voters, who can then authenticate using fingerprint and face recognition to cast their votes.

## Features

- **Admin Control**: Admins can create and manage user profiles and add party members.
- **Biometric Authentication**: Voters authenticate using fingerprint or face recognition to ensure secure access.
- **Voter Credentials**: Admins provide credentials to voters for logging in to the app.
- **Secure Voting Process**: The app ensures a secure and transparent voting process.
